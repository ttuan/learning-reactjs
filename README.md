# Learning React


### Building blocks of a web application
There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
- Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
